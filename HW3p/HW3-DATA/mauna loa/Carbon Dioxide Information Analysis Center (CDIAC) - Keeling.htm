<P>The 40th anniversary of the atmospheric CO<FONT size=-1><SUB>2</FONT></SUB> 
work being done at the <A href="http://cdiac.ornl.gov/new/mlo_pict.html">Mauna 
Loa Observatory</A>, Hawaii, by Dr. Charles D. Keeling, of the <A 
href="http://sio.ucsd.edu/">Scripps Institution of Oceanography (SIO)</A> at the 
<A href="http://www.ucsd.edu/">University of California, San Diego</A>, was 
celebrated in 1997. At a White House ceremony held in July 1997, Dr. Keeling was 
presented with a "special achievement award" from Vice President Al Gore. 
According to the Online SIO Press Release, <B><A 
href="http://sio.ucsd.edu/supp_groups/siocomm/pressreleases/KeelingGore.html">Scripps 
Scientist Receives Science Award from Vice President Al Gore</A></B>, Dr. 
Keeling was honored "for 40 years of outstanding scientific research associated 
with monitoring of atmospheric carbon dioxide in connection with Mauna Loa 
Observatory." 
<P>Widely recognized as the <B><A 
href="http://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/co2/graphics/sio-mlgr.gif">"Keeling 
curve"</A></B>, the Mauna Loa atmospheric CO<FONT size=-1><SUB>2</FONT></SUB> 
concentration measurements, taken since 1958 and now extending through 1997, 
constitute the longest, continuous record of atmospheric CO<FONT 
size=-1><SUB>2</FONT></SUB> concentrations available in the world and are 
considered to be a reliable indicator of the regional trend in the concentration 
of atmospheric CO<FONT size=-1><SUB>2</FONT></SUB> in the middle layers of the 
troposphere. The methods and equipment used to obtain these measurements have 
remained essentially unchanged during the 40-year monitoring program. The 
CO<FONT size=-1><SUB>2</FONT></SUB> concentrations taken at Mauna Loa 
Observatory are obtained using a nondispersive, dual detector, infrared <A 
href="http://cdiac.ornl.gov/new/co2an_pict.html">gas analyzer</A>. The Mauna Loa 
record shows a 15.2% increase in the mean annual concentration, from 315.83 
parts per million by volume (ppmv) of dry air in 1959 to 363.82 ppmv in 1997. 
Each year, the atmospheric CO<FONT size=-1><SUB>2</FONT></SUB> concentration 
varies between a high value in winter (because of biospheric respiration) and a 
low value in summer (because of drawdown by photosynthesis); thus, a wave-like 
pattern is superimposed on the year-to-year increasing trend. 
<P>In 1984, Dr. Keeling made available to CDIAC, a tentative data set, 
<B><I>Atmospheric CO<FONT size=-1><SUB>2</FONT></SUB> Concentrations--Mauna Loa 
Observatory, Hawaii 1958-1983</I></B>. The availability of this landmark numeric 
data package (NDP), <A 
href="http://cdiac.ornl.gov/ndps/ndp001.html">NDP-001</A>, was announced in 
April 1984; it became CDIAC's first NDP, as well as one of the most widely 
recognized and utilized data sets in the CO<FONT size=-1><SUB>2</FONT></SUB> 
research community. 
<P>At the end of Fiscal Year 1984, CDIAC had responded to a total of 18 requests 
for NDP-001. Since then, Dr. Keeling's atmospheric CO<FONT 
size=-1><SUB>2</FONT></SUB> record from Mauna Loa has become one of the most 
sought after data products available from CDIAC and continues to be one of our 
most requested products. CDIAC has now responded to over 10,000 requests for the 
Mauna Loa atmospheric CO<FONT size=-1><SUB>2</FONT></SUB> data through the 
NDP-001 data package and through <A
