<H3>Period of Record</H3>
<P>1958-2004 
<P>
<H3>Methods</H3>
<P>Air samples at Mauna Loa are collected continuously from air intakes at the 
top of four 7-m towers and one 27-m tower. Four air samples are collected each 
hour for the purpose of determining the CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration. 
Determinations of CO<SUB>2</SUB> are made by using a Siemens Ultramat 3 <A 
href="http://cdiac.ornl.gov/trends/co2/graphics/machine.jpg">nondispersive 
infrared gas analyzer</A> with a water vapor freeze trap. This analyzer 
registers the concentration of CO<SUB>2</SUB> in a stream of air flowing at ~0.5 
L/min. Every 30 minutes, the flow is replaced by a stream of calibrating gas or 
"working reference gas". In December 1983, CO<SUB>2</SUB>-in-N<SUB>2</SUB> 
calibration gases were replaced with the currently used CO<SUB>2</SUB>-in-air 
calibration gases. These calibration gases and other reference gases are 
compared periodically to determine the instrument sensitivity and to check for 
possible contamination in the air-handling system. These reference gases are 
themselves calibrated against specific standard gases whose CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
concentrations are determined manometrically. Greater details about the sampling 
methods at Mauna Loa are given in Keeling et al. (1982) and Keeling et al. 
(2002). 
<P>
<P>Hourly averages of atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentration, wind speed, and 
wind direction are plotted as a basis for selecting data for further processing. 
Data are selected for periods of steady hourly data to within ~0.5 parts per 
million by volume (ppmv); at least six consecutive hours of steady data are 
required to form a daily average. Greater details about the data selection 
criteria used at Mauna Loa are given in Bacastow et al. (1985).

<P>
<H3>Trends </H3>The Mauna Loa atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> measurements constitute 
the longest continuous record of atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> concentrations 
available in the world. The Mauna Loa site is considered one of the most 
favorable locations for measuring undisturbed air because possible local 
influences of vegetation or human activities on atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> 
concentrations are minimal and any influences from volcanic vents may be 
excluded from the records. The methods and equipment used to obtain these 
measurements have remained essentially unchanged during the 47-year monitoring 
program. 
<P>Because of the favorable site location, continuous monitoring, and careful 
selection and scrutiny of the data, the Mauna Loa record is considered to be a 
precise record and a reliable indicator of the regional trend in the 
concentrations of atmospheric CO<SUB>2</SUB> in the middle layers of the 
troposphere. The Mauna Loa record shows a 19.4% increase in the mean annual 
concentration, from 315.98 parts per million by volume (ppmv) of dry air in 1959 
to 377.38 ppmv in 2004. The 1997-1998 increase in the annual growth rate of 2.87 
ppmv represets the largest single yearly jump since the Mauna Loa record began 
in 1958. This represents an average annual increase of 1.4 ppmv per year. This 
is smaller than the average annual increase at the other stations because of the 
longer record and inclusion of earlier (smaller) annual increases.
